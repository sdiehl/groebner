# Groebner Basis

This is an implementation of the F4 and Buchberger algorithm for computing Groebner bases in Rust.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Test Suite

The test suite is located in `SUITE.md` it is the full list of known Groebner bases for a variety of large multivariate polynomial systems.
